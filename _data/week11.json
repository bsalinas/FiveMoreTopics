			<ul>
				<li><a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/\">Tableau Public</a>: Arguably the hottest of the products on this list - In addition to being difficult to spell, Tableau makes it easy to make dashboards in an Excel like interface</li>
				<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory\">Google Public Datasets Explorer</a>: Limited to a few visualization techniques, but they have a ton of datasets to play with.</li>
				<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232\">Google Fusion Tables</a>: Google Spreadsheets on steroids (with features like geocoding and some nifty interfaces)</li>
				<li><a href=\"http://fathom.info/mirador/\">Mirador by Fathom</a>: A tool that is primarily for exploring datasets.</li>
				<li><a href=\"https://cartodb.com/\">CartoDB</a>: An easy(ish) interface that lets you build beautiful data-driven maps.</li>
				<li><a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/raw/3156751/\">Parallel Coordinates</a>: A simple tool that lets you upload a CSV file and visualize it using a neat technique</li>

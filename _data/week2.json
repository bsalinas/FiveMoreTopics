			Repetition: Fonts, Colors, Margins,... Font Treatment = type, size, color, style; Count the fonts; desgine fonts up front. Always use them. If not, add a new one. Choose a set of colors. For enterprise software, we do lots of greys. It lets the content shine 
			Margins… but this is also about alignment 
			Alignment: ALWAYS line things up. Left alignment > right alignment (generally) > centered 
			Contrast: If things are not identical, make them very different. This is true with fonts, colors, etc. P
			roximity: Arrange similar information together. If things are supposed to be together, make them closer together. In all these cases, examples!",

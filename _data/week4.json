Keep in mind that it might not be feasible to actually gather data using the tools we discussed from every website. Get the data to the point where you can visualize it in some manner. This could be a simple plot in MATLAB or Excel or using the InDesign DataMerge feature to show the information. The assignment for next week will have you use this data to design a screen."

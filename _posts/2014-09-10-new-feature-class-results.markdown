A few of you asked for the photos from the whiteboards yesterday. I went ahead and added a feature to the website that lets you turn on and off my summary of "results" from the class. I tried to provide an overview of what we discussed for each of the activities. If you think I missed something important, let me know. I also provided my own thoughts on whether the activity went well or how it could have gone better. This will hopefully help identify ways to improve the course if it is ever offered again.
 
You can see the assignments due next week at [the bottom of the page for this past week's class]({{site.baseurl}}/classes/week1#next_week)

Next week (October 7), I will be out of town. Juhan Sonin, Chief Creative Officer of Involution Studios, will be giving a guest lecture on the Design Axioms. With a few other folks, Juhan has crafted a first draft of the set of fundamental principles of interface design.

I've also updated the course schedule for this week and next week. The following week is still a work in progress, but that will hopefully be finalized later this week.

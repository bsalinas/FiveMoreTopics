"AHSE0112","The Olin Conductorless Orchestra","1 AHSE","2-0-1","Audition required.","For information contact: Dabby, Diana","The Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO) - an ensemble, minus conductor - features instrumentalists in leadership and collaborative roles. Dedicated to orchestral performance in the concerted spirit of chamber music, the orchestra forges individual participation, active listening,and group-motivation into performances that have established it as the only conductorless orchestra of its kind at an American college. (A student can apply up to 4 OCO credits to the 28 required credits in AHSE, or can petition to apply up to 4 OCO credits to the AHS concentration. Any additional credits, i.e., more than 4, earned by a student enrolling in OCO will show up as additional AHS credits, but will not count toward satisfying the requisite 28 credits in AHSE.)"

"AHSE1100","History of Technology: A Cultural & Contextual Approach","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Martello, Robert","Throughout this semester we will use different history of technology narratives to explore larger themes. Our narrative case studies will range from bronze age societal studies to cutting edge computing and Internet technologies, and throughout the semester we will compare and contrast these narratives in search of larger trends. We will also identify and investigate broader issues such as large technological systems; paradigms and scientific revolutions; technologies and political values; ethical theories; and the environmental and sustainability implications of technologies. Throughout the semester we will engage these narratives and broader issues through targeted writing activities, debates, individual and group presentations, at least one field trip, movie and media studies, and numerous in-class discussions. Students will have a high degree of autonomy, and will set and evaluate their own learning objectives, determine the topic for final projects, and design and facilitate in-class activities throughout the semester."
"AHSE1130","Seeing and Hearing: Communicating with Photographs, Video and Sound","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Donis-Keller, Helen","Seeing and Hearing is a foundation course that is about the communication of ideas developed by research, reflection, and evolving thought, using contemporary digital media tools as a vehicle for expression. In this project-based course, students will have opportunities for hands-on learning in audio recording and editing, photography and printing, and video recording and editing. Science and engineering content are integrated in order to provide a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the devices we use to gather sound and images and in order to understand more fully the properties of seeing and hearing. A major goal is to enlarge our awareness of the environment we inhabit and to respond to the perceived environment by producing original visual and sonic artwork. Students will complete projects including a self-portrait, a sound-piece that is used as an audio track for a short video, a video documentary, and a staged narrative. Our process is to share work through discussion sessions as we follow projects from their initial stages to completion and final presentation. Additional context for Seeing and Hearing is provided by selected readings, visits by guest lecturers, additional faculty and staff participation and by viewing work of other professional practitioners. This course does not require prior experience with image/sound gathering or editing."
"AHSE1135","The Digital Eye: Photography, Vision, and Visual Communication","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Donis-Keller, Helen","We live in a world that is fundamentally visual and yet formal teaching and learning about visual communication is almost entirely reserved for specialists. Similarly learning about the evolution of vision and the molecular foundations of human vision are not often dealt with in introductory biology courses. This course seeks to remedy the lack of engagement with these topics at the foundational course level. In this studio-based project-oriented course students will develop an understanding of what it takes to make original art through first-hand experiences in a supportive environment. As a means to this end, students will gain facility with digital single- lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, digital photo editing and printing methods using state-of-the-art equipment. As this is an AHS foundation course students will also have an opportunity to further develop writing communication skills and critical thinking ability. The course will also address the history of photography, consider the work of a number of contemporary fine art photographers and answer the question ""Why has photography changed everything?"""
"AHSE1140","Culture & Difference: An Anthropological Approach","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Lynch, Caitrin","This course introduces students to key concepts and methods in cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the study of how humans organize their lives as members of society, and the ways in which they make these lives meaningful. Through readings on such diverse topics as adolescence in Samoa, epilepsy among Hmong-Americans, and McDonald's in Hong Kong, this course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to three central questions: 1) What is culture? 2) Does ""culture"" explain why people do what they do and believe what they believe? 3) What fate and value do cultural differences have in today's interconnected world?"
"AHSE1145","The Human Connection: Tools and Concepts from Anthropology for Understanding Today's World","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Lynch, Caitrin","The book 'Wired to Care' opens with the story of a designer who disguised herself as an elderly person to better understand the experiences of the elderly in our society. Author Dev Patnaik explains his interest in this experiment. It comes down to empathy: ?All of this is to reclaim a very old idea, that quantitative data and facts are no substitute for real-world experience and human connection.? Anthropologists have long-argued for the importance of putting oneself in other people?s shoes for better understanding. The anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski wrote in 1922 that the goal of the anthropologist ?is to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world."" In this course, students will try out the anthropological methods of participation, observation, interviews, and analysis of cultural materials and texts. This is a hands-on course for students who want to get out and meet people ? all with the aim of greater understanding. The course focuses on three thematic topics important to our society in the twenty-first century. Past offerings have focused on aging, religion, health, and globalization. The class includes assignments, events, and interactions that will take students off campus (perhaps to the Needham Senior Center, local coffee shops, and to Boston?s ethnic neighborhoods) and will include visitors from area institutions."
"AHSE1150","What is 'I'?","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Stein, Lynn Andrea","This interdisciplinary exploration of identity draws on a diverse range of genres in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts and Sciences. Prior offerings have drawn from Anthropology, Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Film, History, Literature, Memoir, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Science Fiction, Sociology, and Visual Arts."
"AHSE1155","Identity from the Mind & the Brain: Who Am I and How Do I Know","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Adler, Jonathan","Perhaps the most fundamental question any developing individual asks himself/herself is: who am I? The ways we answer this question have evolved over the course of history as the dominant ways of knowing (epistemologies) have shifted. Indeed, the question of how we come to know ourselves has captivated Western scholars since the days of Descartes, but a look at the last fifty to sixty years has also seen enormous changes. Many people invoke psychological and philosophical perspectives in describing their identity, focusing on their personality, their developmental history, and their place in society. But the explosion of neurobiological research has introduced a new and viable outlook: explaining identity at the chemical and electrical level of the brain. There is good reason to think that these different perspectives on identity are mutually exclusive and this tension will underlie everything we discuss in this interdisciplinary course. Indeed, when it comes to a topic as fundamental to human existence as identity, it is absolutely essential to wonder not only ""who am I?"" but to also ask ""how do I know?"" In this course, we will approach the question of identity from multiple perspectives, including psychology, postmodern philosophy, and neuroscience. In the process, we will critically examine not only the conception of identity that each perspective supports, but also the assumptions and limitations of each epistemology. This course focuses more on the science of psychology and neuroscience, while AHSE 1150: What Is ""I""? is more focused on philosophy and artificial intelligence."
"AHSE2112","Six Books that Changed the World","2 AHSE","4-0-8","AHS Foundation","For information contact: Martello, Robert","Why and how do certain books reshape the course of human history? In this course, we will explore six books, selected from different times, societies, and genres, that have had an unquestionably major impact upon the world in which we live. Class meetings will alternate between contextual studies of the historical context of each book (including the author's background, the political and social setting, and other factors) and careful analyses of the works themselves. Our discussions will investigate each book's contemporary and modern impact while also exploring the qualities that caused all of our selections to have such an enduring and global effect. Students will be expected to contribute to class discussions, make presentations, and write a report on an additional book of their choosing. NOTE: this course will be offered during the first half of the semester, will meet twice a week, and will require approximately 12 hours of student effort each week."
"AHSE1199","Arts, Humanities, Social Science Foundation Topic","4 AHSE","","","","Special Topics in Arts, Humanities and Social Science classes (AHSE X199) typically cover a specific topic in Arts, Humanities and Social Science and are intended to enhance and expand the selection of offerings from semester to semester."
"AHSE2114","Science Fiction and Historical Context","2 AHSE","4-0-8","AHS Foundation","For information contact: Martello, Robert","Science fiction is a wonderful genre that somehow captures a society's ideals, fears, assumptions, and major challenges. In the same way that a historian attempts to piece together complex cause-effect chains to make sense of the past, science fiction writers project the values, technologies, and beliefs of their own societies into alternate or future realities. Our class will work together to understand the conventions of science fiction and explore science fiction works (books, short stories, film) produced in different times, across various cultures, and in different sub-genres of this field."
"AHSE1515","Products and Markets","4 AHSE","","","For information contact: Neeley, Lawrence","Entrepreneur: one who owns and manages a business; a person who takes the risk of profit or loss. - O.E.D. The same source also reveals a broader definition found in the French root, entreprendre, which means ""to undertake."" An entrepreneur is defined as one who assumes the opportunity and full responsibility of any pursuit. A champion."
"AHSE2125","The Engineer's Orchestra II: Theory, Orchestration, Composition","2 AHSE","4-0-8","Wired Ensemble or Permission of Instructor","For information contact: Dabby, Diana","The Engineer?s Orchestra II provides ?just-in-time? harmonic and contrapuntal theory for the study of orchestration, with special attention to voice leading, instrumental doubling, spacing, balance, and color. Each week students complete preliminary exercises that target the skills necessary for that week?s focus of study. They then orchestrate piano reductions of symphonic excerpts, and vice versa, in order to apply these developing skills. The course progresses from scoring for string, woodwind, and brass ensembles to woodwind-string and woodwind-brass-string combinations, and finally the full orchestra. Class discussions involve students defending their technical and artistic decisions, followed by close examination of the choices made by the original composer. Weekly recorded examples bring to life the fundamental concepts underlying the work of past and contemporary orchestrators. Guest appearances/demonstrations by instrumentalists allow students to sharpen their listening skills as they distinguish among the possibilities for bowings and articulations that inform orchestral writing. The course culminates with each student pursuing a final project, such as an original composition or arrangement."
"AHSE1599","Entrepreneurship Foundation Topic","4 AHSE","","","","Special Topics in Entrepreneurship classes (AHSE X599) typically cover a specific topic in Entrepreneurship and are intended to enhance and expand the selection of offerings from semester to semester."
"AHSE2110","The Stuff of History: Materials, Culture in Ancient, Revolutn'ary and Contemporary Times","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Martello, Robert","The lion's share of our history of technology course features a series of readings, lectures, and discussions on the relationship between materials, science, society, and the environment in three historical periods. We start with the material practices and paradigms of Copper and Bronze Age societies, shift to Paul Revere's ""Revolutionary"" work with various metals and fabrication processes, and conclude with a look at the technologies and challenges of tomorrow. We will emphasize the development of three skills that are vital to our studies: contextual thinking, communication (both written and oral), and historical research methods pertaining to source evaluation and narrative construction."
"AHSE2140","Anthropology: Culture, Knowledge and Creativity","4 AHSE","4-0-8","AHS Foundation","For information contact: Lynch, Caitrin","Anthropological theories and methods help us understand human behavior and values. Broadly speaking, anthropologists ask, ""Why do people do what they do and believe what they believe?"" Today, anthropologists study a wide range of contemporary social issues, such as international development, garment manufacturing, the production of scientific knowledge, female ""circumcision,"" and intellectual property. In this course, we will read about, debate, and discuss these and other issues in order to probe into the meanings of culture, knowledge, and creativity."
"AHSE2130","The Intersection of Art and Science","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Donis-Keller, Helen","Science and Art are often considered entirely different worlds inhabited by practitioners who have nothing in common. In this course, we will debunk this myth by closely examining the discovery process in both disciplines and by comparing the culture of science to that of art, historically and in the present. We will consider the influence of scientific discoveries, from optics to ""new media"" on the production of art and discuss the corollary question ""Has art influenced the progress of science?"" We will also consider ways in which science allows us to understand artists and the work they create. In contemporary society, artists have begun to comment on science, sometimes with disastrous results, which leads us to ask, ""What is needed in order to establish a meaningful dialogue between scientists and artists, and does it matter?"""
"AHSE2131","Responsive Drawing and Visual Thinking","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Donis-Keller, Helen","The course assumes no prior experience in drawing. Students will learn to visualize objects in three-dimensional space and commit them to the two-dimensional space of a page, gaining critical experience with ""idea sketching,"" an ability that can be put to many uses in future courses (e.g. project design). Students will also draw subjects from life, i.e. stationary objects and life models using media including charcoal, graphite, cont‚, and ink. The emphasis will be realistic depiction as compared to non-objective abstraction. Students will begin with basic exercises in drawing and rapidly move to more complex intensive drawing experiences. Approximately one-third of the classroom time will be used for drawing from a life model. Class discussion and sketchbook homework assignments will be an essential element in the learning process. Homework assignments will include drawing and visual thinking exercises to be completed in personal sketchbooks. Reading selected text material is also part of the homework requirement. Several invited speakers will contribute to the course and provide informal critiques of student work. One field trip is planned to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge to view art. Other in-class activities will include participation in discussion of drawings (old master and contemporary) that are presented to illustrate various objectives of classroom work (e.g. use of line to indicate form) and group critique sessions. Assessment will be based on weekly homework assignments, classroom work, and three drawing projects to be completed outside of class."
"AHSE3100","Issues in Leadership and Ethics","2 AHSE","2-0-4","Students must be in their final year.","For information contact: Miller, Richard","This course examines the intersection of leadership and ethics in business, engineering, and more general contexts. Readings will include material on the definition and history of ethics and morality in the U.S., the definition and development of leadership skills in a professional context, the role of ethics in the professions, and case studies involving the intersection of leadership and ethics. The course will be structured as a seminar, involving guest speakers and interactive case studies. Enrollment will be limited to 8 students from each college in the final semester of their undergraduate program. The course is typically taught by the Presidents from the The Three College Collaboration."
"AHSE2141","Engineering for Humanity","2 AHSE","6-0-6","","For information contact: Ben-Ur, Ela; Lynch, Caitrin","This course introduces students to engineering problem solving, beginning with understanding client needs and ending with implemented, adaptable, adoptable, and sustainable solutions. This course will draw equally on empathetic and ethnographic methods and on a technical understanding of the problem and solution domains. Over the semester, we will learn about and with our clients; we will identify specific challenges that our clients face; and ? together with our clients ? we will develop concrete solutions to address these challenges. Students will leave Engineering for Humanity with a grounded understanding of the engineering problem solving process, experience in participant-observer fieldwork, and hopefully a feeling of satisfaction at having made a concrete difference in the lives of members of our community."
"AHSE3130","Advanced Digital Photography","4 AHSE","4-0-8","AHSE 1130 or Permission of Instructor","For information contact: Donis-Keller, Helen","In this project-based course, students will develop a personal photographic point of view matched with consistently well-crafted imagery informed by the work of leading contemporary photographers. While communication with visual images is paramount, technical issues will be addressed in some depth. For example, there will be instruction and practice with image capture and editing including High Dynamic Range (HDR) exposure and processing, color management methods and printing, Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop tools and techniques, graphic design and book production methods. Initial projects will stimulate creative thinking and group critiques will help monitor progress and inspire new directions.

"AHSE4590","Entrepreneurship Capstone","4 AHSE","2-0-10","Entrepreneur track; 8 qualifying credits","For information contact: Brand, Stephen","The Entrepreneurship Capstone is an advanced, intensive experience designed to complete a student's undergraduate study of entrepreneurship. The Entrepreneurship Capstone is designed as a seminar that enables students to interact with an experienced entrepreneur in order to accomplish three objectives. First, students will spend the majority of the semester focused on an individual project, the goal of which is expertise in a particular entrepreneurial or business topic. These projects are defined by each student in collaboration with the instructor, and are expected to include a substantial educational component that builds knowledge and expertise throughout the course of the semester. Second, students will undertake one or two assigned projects to strengthen their understanding of entrepreneurship. For example, this may involve an assigned paper/presentation and a community outreach project. Third, students will have the chance to fill knowledge gaps regarding the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. Please contact the instructor with any questions about the course or prerequisites."
"AHSE3510","New Technology Ventures","4 AHSE","4-0-8","","For information contact: Brand, Stephen","Creating a new venture that has technology as a basis for its products or services presents special challenges. On one hand is the ""push"" of new technology, as evidenced by the plethora of scientific invention and technological innovation. On the other hand is the ""pull"" of the market as it presents new entrepreneurial opportunities. Other key challenges present themselves in areas of intellectual property protection, team building and funding opportunities. In this course we will explore entrepreneurship in technology industries in depth with the hope of penetrating the popular veneer, and uncovering the guts of starting a growing new technology ventures. Of course, there is a lot about new technology venturing that is common to all new venture creation, and also the qualities entrepreneurs demonstrate are valuable in a wide spectrum of life's activities. A unique aspect of this course is its desire to include students from both Babson College and Olin College. Particular value from this intermingling will be evidenced in the true interdisciplinary nature of the course field project teams that are formed, and the ability for students to begin to develop networks of relati onships outside their individual domains of business or engineering."

The oldest radiation that we can measure directly corresponds to temperatures of only thousands of degrees, but there is indirect evidence for the early universe requiring temperatures of trillions of degrees. As the universe expands and cools there are still occasional (but quite frequent) episodes involving temperatures of millions or even billions of degrees that are manifested in phenomena like supernovae and black holes. These high energy episodes are not just curiosities - supernovae are responsible for virtually all the chemical elements on Earth more massive than the very lightest, and giant black holes are present at the cores of virtually all galaxies.

In this modern age of healthcare, we are expected to choose amongst an array of therapeutic options for ourselves and for our children rather than respond to specific directives from the medical establishment. In addition, we are called upon as voting citizens to make ethical decisions, e.g. the appropriateness of stem cell cloning. Therefore, it is in the interest of each person to learn more than the fundamentals of biology and genetics in order to make educated choices. In this course we will be concerned with the traditional concepts of human genetics including pedigree analysis, linkage mapping, Mendelian, multi-locus and complex traits, and genetic testing. However, for the most part, the course will view human genetics through a molecular lens. For example, the molecular basis of pathological conditions such as Huntington's disease, hypercholesterolemia, Fragile-X and others will be examined in detail, as will gene imprinting and imprinting-related abnormalities (e.g. Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes). Comparative genomics will be applied to the study of heritable traits in humans. The structure, function, and evolution of the sex chromosomes will also receive special attention. Gene therapy, cloning (stem cell, germ line) and the associated ethical issues will be considered in some depth. Students who are interested in bioengineering or medical school should find this course useful as well as those who have a general interest in the human as an organism."

The third time you go through it, you know you don't understand it, but by that time you are so used to the subject, it doesn't bother you anymore''. In this course we will venture into the depths of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, while concentrating on applications of the abstract concepts to biological, biochemical, and biophysical phenomena and drawing from contemporary bioengineering problems. This course provides an introduction to the study of energy transformations in biological systems as well as thermodynamics and kinetics of structure formation and association of biomolecules. Topics covered include energy and its transformation, the First and Second Law of Thermodynamics, Gibbs Free Energy, statistical thermodynamics, binding equilibria and reaction kinetics, and a survey of other interesting areas of biological thermodynamics, particularly the origin of life on Earth.
